# Performance Test Plan

## Test Objectives
Verify the application can handle expected load without degradation.

## Load Calculations
- Expected daily users: 10,000
- Peak hours: 9am-5pm (8 hours)
- Peak concurrent users: 10,000 / 8 = 1,250/hour = ~21/minute
- Target concurrent users for test: 50

## SLOs (Service Level Objectives)
- Login: < 2s (95th percentile)
- View products: < 1s (95th percentile)
- Add product: < 3s (95th percentile)
- Error rate: < 1%
- System handles 50 concurrent users

## Test Scenarios
1. Ramp-up test: 0→50 users over 2 minutes
2. Sustained load: 50 users for 5 minutes
3. Spike test: 0→100 users instantly

## Metrics to Monitor
- Response times (median, 95th percentile, max)
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Failure rate
- Response time distribution

## Expected Results
- All response times within SLOs
- < 1% error rate
- No crashes or timeouts
- Stable performance throughout test duration
